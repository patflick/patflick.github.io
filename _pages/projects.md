The following are a selection of my current and past projects,
some completed, others still in progress.

mxx

mxx is a C++11 template header-only library for MPI. It provides efficient
and typesafe C++ bindings for MPI functionality, and implements some common
parallel distributed-memory algorithms (e.g. sorting).

This project started as a simple C++ MPI interface in one of my projects,
and is now used by multiple different projects.

This library is open source and available on Github.

Analysis of human tissue-specific protein-protein interaction networks
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proteins are the core machinery of all living cells and protein interactions
determine
the inner workings of life itself. Insights into the nature of these
interactions
are important for learning about how and why cells work. The interactions
between
all proteins in a cell compose a so-called protein-protein interaction (PPI)
network, in form of a graph. Not all proteins are present in all cell and tissue
types, hence protein interactions are restricted to cell and tissue types where
both
interacting proteins exist. These tissue dependent interactions form
tissue-specific
PPI (TSPPI) networks.
In this project, we construct and analyze TSPPI networks from different data
sources. We follow the goal to gain insights into the structure of interactions
as
well as into the properties of specific groups of proteins inside the TSPPI
networks.
To that end, we implement an analysis pipeline and develop efficient analysis
algorithms, which operate on our graph representation for TSPPI networks.
Moreover, we study the basic properties of TSPPI networks and investigate
properties
of certain classes of proteins. Then, we provide a method to identify proteins
which gain in importance by cellular specialization. Furthermore, we re-evaluate
prior research results on a large set of TSPPIs and demonstrate that some
previous
conclusions have to be reconsidered. Finally, we employ clustering algorithms
with the objective to identify tissue-specific functional modules within TSPPIs.
In addition to using available clustering methods, we pursue two more approaches.
