I'm a PhD student in [Computational Science and Engineering](http://cse.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://gatech.edu/).

My research interests are in parallel and **high performance computing**, **algorithm engineering**, **string algorithms**, and **graph algorithms**.
I'm advised by Professor [Srinivas Aluru](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~saluru/).
